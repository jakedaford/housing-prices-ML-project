This project is based on the Ames, Iowa house pricing dataset as provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/). All collaborators worked together to apply many different types of regression algorithms in order to minimize the error in predicted housing sale prices.
